    <h2>Style attribute and tag</h2>
    <h3>ID selectors</h3>
    <p id="id-selector-1">
      Instead of changing the look and feel of all the elements of the same
      name, e.g., P, we can refer to a specific element by its ID
    </p>
    <p id="id-selector-2">
      Here's another paragraph using a different ID and a different look and
      feel
    </p>
    <h3>Class selectors</h3>
    <p class="wd-class-selector">
      Instead of using IDs to refer to elements, you can use an element's CLASS
      attribute
    </p>
    <h4 class="wd-class-selector">
      This heading has same style as paragraph above
    </h4>
    <div class="wd-selector-1">
      <h3>Document structure selectors</h3>
      <div class="wd-selector-2">
        Selectors can be combined to refer elements in particular places in the
        document
        <p class="wd-selector-3">
          This paragraph's red background is referenced as
          <br />.selector-2 .selector3<br />
          meaning the descendant of some ancestor.
          <br />
          <span class="wd-selector-4"
            >Whereas this span is a direct child of its parent</span
          >
          <br />
          You can combine these relationships to create specific styles
          depending on the document structure
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <h3 class="wd-fg-color-blue">Foreground color</h3>
    <p class="wd-fg-color-red">
      The text in this paragraph is red but
      <span class="wd-fg-color-green">this text is green</span>
    </p>
